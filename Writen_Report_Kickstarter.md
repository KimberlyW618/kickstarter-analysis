Successful campaigns had lower goals then failed ones. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This data set does not account for different currencies and their conversion rates.
 It does not provide analysis on the marketing strategy that has been emplyed for fundraising. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Box plots for other subcategories in the US. 
Bar graphs that would tell more information about the Theater subcategories to help Louise visualize the successful campaigns.
